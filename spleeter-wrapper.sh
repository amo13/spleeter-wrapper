#     A script for using spleeter with audio of any length
#     and with limited RAM on the processing machine

#     Cracks are the reason the overlap correction in this script is needed:
#     "
#     Spleeter is adding a tiny padding after each output stem file,
#     what makes a small gap when stitching back the 30's chunks in one single stem
#     "
#     From: https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/437#issue-648995964
#
#     "
#     The padding is unavoidable, due to a strange behavior of the STFT of tensorflow
#     that spleeter uses but does not compensate for.
#     "
#     From: https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/437#issuecomment-652516231
#
#     "
#     You can feed an audio file of any length into the script and the whole process
#     is not going to eat more than 2GB RAM. I think for me [Amaury] it was around 1.6GB.
#
#     How it works:
#
#       1. Split the audio file into 30s parts.
#       2. Process them all with spleeter.
#       3. Join the resulting stem-parts to the full-length stems.
#       4. Split the audio file again into 30s parts but with the first part being only 15s long.
#       5. Process them again with spleeter.
#       6. Join the results to full-length stems again.
#       7. Replace 3s around every crack in the first stems with the respective 3 seconds from the second stems.
#       8. Clean up.
#
#     Downside:
#
#       1. Processes the audio twice with spleeter.
#       2. The result is not 100% accurate: on a 3m30s track the stems were around 200ms too long.
#       I am not sure about what exactly caused the 200ms error for me. I was suspecting ffmpeg being inaccurate
#       when splitting and joining, but I don't really know. Anyway, the resulting stems are totally acceptable.

#
#     Overlap correction process, explained by the original author Amaury (@amo13) on github:
#     "
#     Basically, it needs to process the input audio twice but with the
#     second processing doing one 15 seconds chunk, and then again 30s
#     chunks for the rest. Then it takes 3s around the crack in the first
#     processing from the second one, and puts everything back together.
#     It's probably not ideal but maybe someone will have a good idea how
#     to make it better.

#
#     TODO: "rather than doing the work of splitting up the input files, one can use the -s (aka --offset) option to the separate command.
#                  This way, you can process a single file iteratively using spleeter, rather than splitting it up manually beforehand."

#
#     Disk space usage, at most: Size of original file when converted to WAV * # of stems * 2 (since -30 and -offsets) * 2 (under joinParts when splitting into 1s clips).
#     So if an orig. 2h audio file in WAV is 669 MB, and we use spleeter with 5stems, then it would take 669 * 5 * 2 * 2 = 13380 MB = 13.38 GB disk space during processing.
